# Documentation-QA-using-LlamaIndex-and-Milvus

ChatGPT is being explored by companies to improve product documentation search functionality. LlamaIndex and Milvus work together to ingest and retrieve relevant information. LlamaIndex embeds documents using OpenAI, while Milvus retrieves relevant text and metadata. When a user asks a question, LlamaIndex searches through Milvus for the closest answers and uses ChatGPT to summarize those answers. This approach could replace the tedious process of combuing through product documentation pages.
